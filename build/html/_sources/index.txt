`telomerecat` estimates the average length of telomeres given whole genome sequencing (WGS) files as input. Length estimation takes into account noise genereated by interstital telomeric sequences and the subtelomere to provide a more accurate estimate. The biology and technical aspects of WGS are considered in an attempt to only measure true telomereic reads.

`telomerecat` is designed to run quickly on either your desktop or remote high powered computing facility. The amount of processors and memory is adjustable to the computing resources available to each user.  

Installing `telomerecat` is very similar to other python programs and can be acheived most easily by using pip. Precompiled binaries, requring no installation, are available for both MacOSX and Linux platforms.
